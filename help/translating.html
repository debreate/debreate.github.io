      <h1 class="header">Translating with Poedit</h1>

      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> I noticed that some of the translators were using a program called
        <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" target="_main">Poedit</a>, so I decided to try it out. It
        is a great tool and simplifies the translation process. I recommend using it. After you
        download
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debreate/debreate/master/locale/debreate.pot">
        Debreate's .pot file</a>, just open Poedit, go to the File menu and select "New catalog from
        POT file". Open Debreate's .pot and begin translating. When you save the translated .po file
        it will automatically compile it into a binary .mo file. This is much simpler and quicker
        than the instructions I have laid out below. But I will keep them up because they may be
        helpful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another important note, if you see two curly braces ({}) or a percent followed by an "s"
        (%s) in the original .pot file these need to be kept in the translation. These are symbols
        that the program uses for substituting text. For example if you see this:
      </p>

      <p class="indent">"Debreate version {}" or "Debreate version %s"</p>

      <p>The program will replace "{}" or "%s" with Debreate's current version number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h1 class="header">Translating without Poedit</h1>

      <p>
        The first thing to do is to install gettext (it will probably already be installed along
        with Debreate):
      </p>

      <p class="terminal indent">sudo apt-get install gettext</p>

      <p>Now copy Debreate's .pot file to your current directory:</p>

      <p class="terminal indent">cp /usr/share/debreate/locale/debreate.pot ./debreate.po</p>

      <p>
        You can also get the current .pot file
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debreate/debreate/master/locale/debreate.pot">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally the translated files are renamed with a .po extension, but it will not affect
        anything if you do not change it. Now edit the file with your favorite text editor. The file
        should look something like this:
      </p>

      <img src="/res/screenshot/po-orig.png">

      <p>
        The first line that we need to look at is pictured as line 16. You need to change the
        encoding type. It will probably be UTF-8, so change this line:
      </p>
      <p class="terminal indent">
      "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
      </p>
      <p>To this:</p>
      <p class="terminal indent">"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"</p>

      <p>
        Now we are ready to begin translating. Below you will see sections with fields "msgid" and
        "msgstr". The "msgid" field will be followed by the original text in quotations. "msgstr"
        will be followed by empty quotations. Translate the text in the "msgid" field and enter into
        the "msgstr" field.
      </p>

      <img src="/res/screenshot/po-es.png">

      <p>
        When you are done save and close it. Now we need to compile it into binary. Use the
        following command:
      </p>
      <p class="terminal indent">msgfmt debreate.po -o debreate.mo</p>

      <p>
        This binary file needs to be placed in Debreate's locale directory. But first we need to
        make a couple of sub-directories. You first need to create a sub-directory for your
        language. For example if you are translating to Spanish, you would create the directory
        called "es" (If the translation is specific to a country you can use the country code in the
        filename: "es_MX" for Mexico). Then inside the "es" directory, create a folder called
        LC_MESSAGES:
      </p>
      <p class="terminal indent">sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/debreate/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES</p>

      <p>Now place the .mo file into that directory:</p>
      <p class="terminal indent">sudo cp debreate.mo /usr/share/debreate/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES</p>

      <p>
        You are all finished. Now open Debreate to view your translation. If you would like your
        translation to be distributed with debreate, send me a copy of the edited .po file. I will
        also include your name in Debreate's credits unless you state that you do not want that. Let
        me know how you want your name/alias to be displayed or I will just write it as I see it in
        your email.
      </p>

      <h1 class="header">Updating Translations</h1>
      <p>
        In future versions Debreate's displayed text may change, causing translated .po files to
        become outdated. If you would like to update an existing .po file you can do the following:
        Get a copy of the
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debreate/debreate/master/locale/debreate.pot">
          most current .pot file</a> and use the following command to update the old .po
          translation:
      </p>
      <p class="terminal indent">msgmerge -U debreate.po debreate.pot</p>

      <p>
        You can optionally use the "--lang" argument to set the language of the output .po file:
      </p>
      <p class="terminal indent">msgmerge -U --lang=es_MX debreate.po debreate.pot</p>

      <p>Now translate any empty "msgstr" fields in the updated .po translation file.</p>
